## ðŸ“– Overview

This package provides a **Python implementation** of the positivity preserving projection and linear interpolation backtracking implemented using Numpy and Scipy. To get started, look at a simple example of this projection in  [`tutorial.ipynb`](tutorial.ipynb).

### ðŸ“‚ Required Data Files:

This repository contains code to apply the positivity preserving projection on a catalytic reactor dataset, an atmospheric chemistry dataset and a dataset with randomly generated concentrations. For the catalytic reactor dataset and the random concentration dataset all files are available in this repository. The atmospheric chemistry dataset is taken from _Sturm & Silva_ [DOI: 10.1021/acsestair.4c00220](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestair.4c00220) and must be downloaded under:  

[DOI: zenodo.org/records/13385987](https://zenodo.org/records/13385987), "experiments_11e5_1hour_5mins_falsecombinatoricratelaws.csv"  
Place the downloaded file into the `data/OzonePhotochemistry/` directory.  

### ðŸ›  Code Structure:
- **Running experiments** Evaluation of model predictions and projections for all three datasets is in [`main.py`](main.py).
- **Projections for correcting surrogate models** Positivity preserving projection, orthogonal projection and linear interpolation backtracking are found under [`PositivityPreservingProjection/projections.py`](PositivityPreservingProjection/projections.py)
- **Evaluation for catalytic reactor dataset** Data is found in [`data/CatalyticReactor/ngasT_inlet_outlet.npy`](data/CatalyticReactor/ngasT_inlet_outlet.npy) and data handling is provided by [`PositivityPreservingProjection/catalyticreactor_dataset.py`](PositivityPreservingProjection/catalyticreactor_dataset.py). The trained neural network surrogate weights are available under  [`models/CatalyticReactorModel.pt`](models/CatalyticReactorModel.pt) and the model class under [`PositivityPreservingProjection/models.py`](PositivityPreservingProjection/models.py).
- **Evaluation for ozone photochemistry dataset** Data handling is provided by [`PositivityPreservingProjection/ozonephotochemistry_dataset.py`](PositivityPreservingProjection/ozonephotochemistry_dataset.py). The trained neural network surrogate weights are available under [`models/OzonePhotochemistryModel.pt`](models/OzonePhotochemistryModel.pt) and the model class under [`PositivityPreservingProjection/models.py`](PositivityPreservingProjection/models.py).
- **Evaluation for random concentration dataset** Data handling is provided by [`PositivityPreservingProjection/randomconcentration_dataset.py`](PositivityPreservingProjection/randomconcentration_dataset.py).
